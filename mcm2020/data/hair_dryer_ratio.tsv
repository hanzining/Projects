Beauty	5	23	23	N	Y	best wall mounted unit on the market	right after i first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a california motel i have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms i have used competitive designs in other motels but find that this one is still the best and is reasonably durable based on my experience i would guess that a unit is good for about 3000 uses at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use not counting the cost of electricity in addition to high and low fan settings it also has two power heat settings 1200 watts and 1500 watts i prefer the higher one the unit is shipped with the 1200 watt setting in order to set it to 1500 watts you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch you can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit you may need to experiment some and use some sharp uturns to get the length just right for your situation you should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector i use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod it fits just right into the pry notch i too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit when you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in the newer model uses a magnetic mount you dont have to jam it in but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand	2014-08-28	1	2014-08-01

for you	let me address the title of the review from the very first day she used this thing she started getting compliments about her hair her hair is normally pretty straight and flat and it definitely had more body it was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever thats worth the compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look but my wife is still raving about itbr br i purchased this for her because i got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years the latest one i put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online she and i needed a change i read all of the good reviews on amazon and elsewhere and gave it a shotbr br the elchim is everything i hoped for in a hairdryer the first thing my wife and i both noticed was that it was much quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers lowest setting we can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair i figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing but i was very concerned when she dried my daughters hair it definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerfulbr br secondly the quieter airflow was very powerful 1500 litersminute is the claim i havent ever seen another volume measurement but it sounds impressive right anyway as others have stated my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally she thought i was nuts when i showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet but she was pleasantly surprised it has a removable filter screen twistoff on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time the buildup of hairspray makeup lint and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it this congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the pastbr br elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavyduty use it has a thick round cord which will be much less prone to tangling it is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned it has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor this will prove great for packing i expect it to last for yearsbr br i read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers tourmaline ceramic heating elements emf etc but none swayed me away from common sense see belowbr br the ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair a few things on that moisture weight weight flat conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down many use wax which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair downbr br there are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes science note breaking down a molecule of water h2o leaves hydrogen peroxide ho and a free hydrogen atom h we now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes right ionic dryers dont heat the air they heat the hair from within isnt that what microwaves do there are good ionic dryers out there but be wary of the claims some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches i did not see a need to risk anything like thatbr br last thing about ionic dryers the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last a good ionic dryer will cost you more than the 2995 delivered versions read the reviews none of the 5star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency lack of performance and breaking down altogether if you want a good ionic dryer be prepared to spend a little if the cheapies were the answer they would be in use in the salonsbr br bottom line your hearing matters protect it proven technology matters ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry ergonomics matter packability weight and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer my wifes arrived in all blackso what she never paraded one around in the past and i dont expect her to anytime soon they only make black white red and redblack no neon or orange surprises there is no substitute for quality and durability while you may not always get what you pay for if you buy cheap things the adage holds truebr br i researched these things thoroughly before i bought it and read several reviews where people were using their elchim hair dryers for 10 years i have no doubt that this will follow those lines salons around the world use them several hours per day ours should last for years well worth the 60ish i paidbr br update feb 20 2010 br br after about two years and no abuse the cord on my wifes hairdryer crapped the bed what is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle i expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped it broke where it should have never been an issue i cut the cord about two inches from the solder points where i thought the break would be intending to solder back on as it turned out the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut when i dissected the failed portion it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process i still hold that the hairdryer is topnotch i will repair the cord on the next one i get if i get the same model why do i need another one read onbr br for the guys out there saying no biggy i can fix a cord beware for the record this thing is a beast to disassemble and reassemble iwork with all sorts of electronics when it originally failed i opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal once i was inside i saw the problem was not there however there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair after reassembling the hairdryer i could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter i threw it out after much frustration and solder it did work when i got it back together but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concernbr br i regret doing this because i was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break alas i was wrong i think i will look for a newerdifferent model by the same manufacturer i did not contact elchim to see how much a repair was after shipping both ways im sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself i did email them a detailed description of the failure though nobody has replied to that letter my wife hates the replacement dryertourmaline and wants her elchim backbr br for all those that i doubted im stupid youre smart i was wrong you were right youre the best im the worst youre very good looking im not attractive from happy gilmore i thought about posting pictures of my failure but whats the point i edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke good electrician possibly a good deal i would change my star rating but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot if you read this far you must have felt it was helpful tooor at least amusingbr br update december 2013 br br when the last one died my fault three years back i didnt replace it because she had purchased a cheap standin while i wrongfully attempted to fix the cord she simply kept using it after i killed the elchim i put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than i should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die well it lives on but my patience broke i reluctantly coughed up the money for a new elchim same model just different color omg its so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning we can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair shell probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again i felt a bit stupid after i killed the first one and i didnt want to augment that feeling by spending for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement now that i swallowed my pride and replaced the elchim everyones happierand im sure we hear a little better
